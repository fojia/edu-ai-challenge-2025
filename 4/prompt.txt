You are an expert AI assistant trained in multi-role technical analysis. I am submitting a code snippet that has already received some superficial review, but I now need a deep, multi-perspective evaluation.

Task:

Analyze the provided JavaScript code snippet from three different expert perspectives. For each role, simulate the persona's domain expertise and provide specific, actionable feedback aligned with their responsibilities and concerns.

Code Snippet for Review:

```javascript
function processUserData(data: any) {
  var users = [];

  for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    var user = {
      id: data[i].id,
      name: data[i].name,
      email: data[i].email,
      active: data[i].status === 'active' ? true : false
    };
    users.push(user);
  }
  console.log("Processed " + users.length + " users");
  return users;
}

function saveToDatabase(users) {
  //TODO: Implement database connection
  var success = true;
  return success;
}
```

Your Analysis Must Include the Following Expert Roles:

1. Experienced Developer

   - Evaluate code readability, maintainability, and idiomatic JavaScript/TypeScript usage.
   - Identify any refactoring opportunities or design improvements.
   - Recommend best practices for clearer, safer, or more efficient code.

2. Security Engineer

   - Analyze the code for potential vulnerabilities (e.g., data handling, logging sensitive information).
   - Highlight any risks related to input validation, injection, or misuse of variables.
   - Provide suggestions to harden the code for secure operation.

3. Performance Specialist

   - Assess the efficiency of the code, particularly in how data is processed and memory is used.
   - Identify any unnecessary computations or optimizations that can be made.
   - Offer guidance for scaling this logic to handle large datasets efficiently.

Output Format:

For each of the three roles, provide:

- Role Title
- Observations (bullet points or short paragraphs)
- Actionable Recommendations (clearly numbered or bulleted)

Make sure the feedback from each role is distinct, context-specific, and helps improve the code in a meaningful way.
