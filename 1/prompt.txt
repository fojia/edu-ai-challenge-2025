You are an expert in system architecture and database design. I want you to use Chain-of-Thought reasoning to help select the most suitable database type for a social platform with the following requirements. Think step-by-step and explain each factor before making a recommendation.

Project Requirements:

- The application is a social platform with millions of users.
- It needs to store:

    - User profiles
    - User posts
    - Connections (relationships) between users
- The workload consists of 80% read operations and 20% write operations.
- High data read speed is critical.
- The system must be highly scalable as the user base is expected to grow significantly.

Your Task:

- Break down the requirements and analyze the implications of each (e.g., data model, performance, scalability).
- Compare the advantages and trade-offs of different types of databases (e.g., relational, document, graph, key-value, wide-column).
- Identify which database types are suitable or unsuitable for the given use case and why.
- Justify your final recommendation step-by-step based on the needs above.
- End with a clear recommendation of the best type of database for the platform.
